Email: The ice cube in the glass of water (10/22/15)
* Is not an example of the irreversibility of time because it's not a closed system. Something had to put the ice cube there. So even though the resulting state after melting is a cold glass of water, the resulting state of the rest of the system is different than it would be if it had just begun as a cold glass of water. * The fact that something is different means that time may be predictive in reverse.
* Counterpoint: take 2 causes and swap them with their effects.
* Counterpoint #2: dropping ice cube in water and waiting 5 minutes, vs waiting 5 minutes and then dropping the cube in. Rearrange the order of causes. Resulting state an hour later is the same? Perhaps not: is the state of your arm the same? Is the amount of information the same? You had the thought of dropping the ice cube in for a longer amount of time, didn't you?
* Conservation of information, p. 167
* Is space referential to the observer? Or is it time? Or both?  Referentiality? Or relativity?
* Multiple arrows of time, p. 171, bottom: These sentences show that time is self referential to the observer, the experiencer of the time.

Email: Perhaps the second law is backwards (10/21)
* It's not that entropy increases with time, but rather that time increases with entropy.
Acceleration, the second law, gravity, dark energy & matter, they all have time in the denominator. Perhaps they are all the same effect--i.e. movement through (dense) space over time.

Email: 4d spacetime = "Cartesian spacetime" (10/14 - 10/21)
* Except there's good evidence a f ain't Cartesian, so why try so hard to hold on to that concept? Trying to make everything agree is doomed from the start.
* Evidence that time is different [from space] is in the paragraph at the bottom of p. 123 [of Sean Carrol's book].
* Rather than having 3 dims of space and one of time, one could imagine having 3 of space and one of velocity, and then time can be derived from that. Then you probably need acceleration though also, etc. I.e. a single dimension of time isn't enough to describe the state of spacetime.
* p. 130, momentum = mass * velocity; and in relativity momentum goes to infinity as v approaches c (relativistic mass/velocity)
* Acceleration can't happen without adding energy so perhaps its energy that affects (ie speeds up) time.  E.g. what if you heat up a clock? Will that slow time down?
* In physics, credit accrues not just to someone who makes an offhand suggestion, but... (p. 138)

**Time = Gravity**

Email: Another dimension (10/12/15)
* If there were another dimension that we don't know about, that could explain why accelerated trajectories take less time. I.e., we aren't including all of the relevant dimensions in the spacetime equation.
* Perhaps gravity/acceleration is that additional dimension. Just like in that MIT machine learning [video on SVMs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PwhiWxHK8o) (towards the end) where he adds another dimension to make large margin classifier work in the presence of noisy data.
* Perhaps "space density" is that other dimension, though this would clearly have to be dependent on gravity/acceleration.

Email: Does time travel through space? (10/10/15)
* Like sound travels through air?
* Lookup that aether experiment.  (I.e. is space time's aether?)
* You also can't have negative sound.  (There are lots of things with limits, like the speed of light.)

Email: Discrete Time (10/8/15)
* Is there any reason to think that time is continuous? Is anything continuous? Particles? Fields? Why would time be? Maybe because gravity is? I.e. because time is a distance metric.

Email: If the expansion of the universe is accelerating (10/8/15)
* Then we, our galaxy, must be accelerating in some direction, but why can't we feel it?
* A: Because it's not that objects are accelerating through space; it's that space between objects is growing/stretching at an accelerating rate.
* Podcast: Ep. 279 Hubble Constant | Astronomy Cast (10/21/15)
  * It's not that distant galaxies are accelerating away from us; it's that the space between us and distant galaxies is expanding causing them to appear like they're accelerating away.
  * This is why we, and they, don't feel the acceleration?

Email: Gravity and universe expansion are related (9/29/15)
* The hypothesis (prior to dark energy) was that gravity would slow it down. But what if cause and effect are wrong. What if universe expansion causes gravity. At the moment of the BB there was no gravity.

Email: On pg 81 (or on a piece of paper inserted) of Sean Carroll's book (9/29/15)
* Draw 3 2d squares representing space at different points in time. And make a circle move across the space, changing position at each. This is a massive object moving through time.
* Below this, draw another series of squares, but this time put the 3 locations of the circle all in the same square. This can't happen of course, but this is what it would look like to move through space while time stands still. This is outside the light cone.

Email: "Bumpiness and randomness"
* Create smoothness. Things work better when they are disorganized. Perhaps this applies to quantum mechanics

Email: "Randomness doesn't come up in nature"
* It only comes up in stuff like markets and sports where sentient beings are competing. Perhaps it does in nature tho, eg when species compete. The point is that perhaps quantum mechanics is some sort of competition also, and if we understood it better we could predict it better

Email: "Predictability of anything is a figment"
* Quantum unpredictability is transitive with the unpredictability of fate

Email: "If stuff like..."
* ...light and radio can travel through space, that must mean that consecutive chunks of space can pass the waves from chunk to the next, which means they must be nonempty. Perhaps particles that have twins are chunks of space that have been separated, ie noncontiguous space.
* is space is discreet, just like quantum leaps, b/c this would also suggest the discrete chunks could be separated

Idea: the Big Bang as a finely tuned boundary condition
* "If our universe began at the Big Bang, it is burdened with a finely tuned boundary condition for which we have no good explanation.  But if the observed universe is part of a bigger ensemble--the multiverse--then we might be able to explain why a tiny part of that ensemble witnesses such a dramatic change in entropy from one end of time to the other."
* But what if the beginning of time is like Absolute 0 temperature, which is another "finely tuned boundary condition?
* An odd thing about this is that temperature is related to pressure, and so this might relate to my _space pressure_ idea where matter is the absence of space, i.e. low space pressure, the source of gravitational fields (objects being attracted towards each other due to low space pressure).

Email: Time, gravity, and the curvature of space (7/10/15)
* https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_wave
* Are gravity and time duals of each other? They both seem to have something to do with the curvature of space.
