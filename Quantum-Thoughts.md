*Time = Gravity*

Email: Gravity and universe expansion are related (9/29/15)
* The hypothesis (prior to dark energy) was that gravity would slow it down. But what if cause and effect are wrong. What if universe expansion causes gravity. At the moment of the BB there was no gravity.

* Draw 3 2d squares representing space at different points in time. And make a circle move across the space, changing position at each. This is a massive object moving through time.
* Below this, draw another series of squares, but this time put the 3 locations of the circle all in the same square. This can't happen of course, but this is what it would look like to move through space while time stands still. This is outside the light cone.

Email: "Bumpiness and randomness"
* Create smoothness. Things work better when they are disorganized. Perhaps this applies to quantum mechanics

Email: "Randomness doesn't come up in nature"
* It only comes up in stuff like markets and sports where sentient beings are competing. Perhaps it does in nature tho, eg when species compete. The point is that perhaps quantum mechanics is some sort of competition also, and if we understood it better we could predict it better

Email: "Predictability of anything is a figment"
* Quantum unpredictability is transitive with the unpredictability of fate

Email: "If stuff like..."
* ...light and radio can travel through space, that must mean that consecutive chunks of space can pass the waves from chunk to the next, which means they must be nonempty. Perhaps particles that have twins are chunks of space that have been separated, ie noncontiguous space.
* is space is discreet, just like quantum leaps, b/c this would also suggest the discrete chunks could be separated

Idea: the Big Bang as a finely tuned boundary condition
* "If our universe began at the Big Bang, it is burdened with a finely tuned boundary condition for which we have no good explanation.  But if the observed universe is part of a bigger ensemble--the multiverse--then we might be able to explain why a tiny part of that ensemble witnesses such a dramatic change in entropy from one end of time to the other."
* But what if the beginning of time is like Absolute 0 temperature, which is another "finely tuned boundary condition?
* An odd thing about this is that temperature is related to pressure, and so this might relate to my _space pressure_ idea where matter is the absence of space, i.e. low space pressure, the source of gravitational fields (objects being attracted towards each other due to low space pressure).

Email: Time, gravity, and the curvature of space (7/10/15)
* https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_wave
* Are gravity and time duals of each other? They both seem to have something to do with the curvature of space.
