* Create smoothness. Things work better when they are disorganized. Perhaps this applies to quantum mechanics

Email: "Randomness doesn't come up in nature"
* It only comes up in stuff like markets and sports where sentient beings are competing. Perhaps it does in nature tho, eg when species compete. The point is that perhaps quantum mechanics is some sort of competition also, and if we understood it better we could predict it better

Email: "Predictability of anything is a figment"
* Quantum unpredictability is transitive with the unpredictability of fate

* ...light and radio can travel through space, that must mean that consecutive chunks of space can pass the waves from chunk to the next, which means they must be nonempty. Perhaps particles that have twins are chunks of space that have been separated, ie noncontiguous space.
* is space is discreet, just like quantum leaps, b/c this would also suggest the discrete chunks could be separated
