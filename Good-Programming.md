[Three Laws of Programs](http://jeremymikkola.com/posts/2015_08_28_warming_up_to_go.html):
  1. A program must not be hard for a human to understand, nor though lack of clarification allow a misunderstanding to take place.
  2. A program must be fast and concise, unless it conflicts with the first law.
  3. A program must be easy for the computer to understand, unless it conflicts with first two laws.

  Others have [stated this better](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/front/node3.html) as “programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.”
