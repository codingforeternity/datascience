#### On IRAs
* Traditional IRA - pre-tax, no taxes paid up front
* Roth IRA - post-tax, pay taxes up front and then grow tax free, no taxes at redemption
  * income caps in order to contribute to Roths (we're too high for '16)
  * also can't contribute to Roth if you have *any* money in a pre-tax IRA, even if it's from 10 years ago
* 2017 plan
  * since our income will be low this year, it's a good year to convert into a Roth (and be taxed)
    * is this what Howard referred to as a "backdoor Roth"?
  * if we convert all of Michelle's IRA, then she no longer has a pre-tax IRA and so can make contributions in the future
  * the lowest income tax bracket of 15% extends up to 75k (for a couple, or individual?)
  * talk to Howard in November
