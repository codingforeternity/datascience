#### [Bayesian statistics: What’s it all about?](http://andrewgelman.com/2016/12/13/bayesian-statistics-whats/) (12/15/16)
* "Bayesian statistics uses the mathematical rules of probability to combine data with prior information to yield inferences which (if the model being used is correct) are more precise than would be obtained by either source of information alone."
* "In contrast, classical statistical methods avoid prior distributions. In classical statistics, you might include in your model a predictor (for example), or you might exclude it, or you might pool it as part of some larger set of predictors in order to get a more stable estimate."

### * [Streaming Model for Linear Regression](http://koaning.io/bayesian-propto-streaming-algorithms.html) (12/1/16)
* **iterative, on-line/streaming approach to linear regression** (convergence of a posterior distribution--"the conditional probability distribution of the unobserved quantities of ultimate interest, given the observed data" [see [[Machine Learning Notes]]]) (kws: prior)
* nice brief explanation of Bayesian Statistics
* and really nice examples of Python plotting and likihood
* in Python and with reference to Apache Flink and Spark
* "if you've solved streaming then you've also solved batch"
* "Batch is a subset of streaming and thinking like a bayesian helps when designing models."

* [Statistically Controlling for Confounding Constructs Is Harder than You Think](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0152719)
* "if you want to control for a certain variable, let’s call it C, your ability to succesfully correct for it is limited by the reliability of your measure of C. Let’s call your experimental measure (or construct) Cm. If you find that a certain correlation holds true even controling for Cm, this might be because C is not really a confound, but it might also be that Cm is a poor measure of C. “Controlling for Cm” is not the same as “Controlling for C”."
