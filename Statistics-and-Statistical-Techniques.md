### * [Streaming Model for Linear Regression](http://koaning.io/bayesian-propto-streaming-algorithms.html) (12/1/16)
* **iterative, on-line/streaming approach to linear regression** (convergence of a posterior distribution--"the conditional probability distribution of the unobserved quantities of ultimate interest, given the observed data" [see [[Machine Learning Notes]]])
* nice brief explanation of Bayesian Statistics
* and really nice examples of Python plotting and likihood
* in Python and with reference to Apache Flink and Spark
* "if you've solved streaming then you've also solved batch"
* "Batch is a subset of streaming and thinking like a bayesian helps when designing models."

* "if you want to control for a certain variable, let’s call it C, your ability to succesfully correct for it is limited by the reliability of your measure of C. Let’s call your experimental measure (or construct) Cm. If you find that a certain correlation holds true even controling for Cm, this might be because C is not really a confound, but it might also be that Cm is a poor measure of C. “Controlling for Cm” is not the same as “Controlling for C”."
