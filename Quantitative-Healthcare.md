[Cancer drug development time halved thanks to artificial intelligence](http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2015/10/13/artificial-intelligence-you-say)
* Berg Health’s team used a specialised form of artificial intelligence to compare samples taken from patients with the most aggressive strains of cancer, including pancreatic, bladder and brain, with those from non-cancerous individuals. The technology highlighted disparities between the corresponding biological profiles, selecting those it predicted would respond best to the drug.

* In that the rate of new drug discovery is massively slowing down.  The real gains to come are in genetics.

* Maybe a lot can be learned from failed drug studies if deep learning is applied because it doesn't sound like we know how drugs work. http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonkblog/wp/2015/07/23/one-big-myth-about-medicine-we-know-how-drugs-work/
* Or maybe research them differently: Generate random compounds and give them to mice.  Then monitor the mice in tons of different ways (gene expression perhaps the most comprehensive) for effects.  Then use machine learning to figure out what compounds do what.  It might point someone in the right direction if nothing else.

Idea: EMR
* From a large set of primary care patient records, identify individuals who might have unusual health conditions. (this idea was taken from this quiz https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/exam/Dx28I/anomaly-detection)
* Perhaps we want to flag such patients in addition to the 8 maladies

* If so, use that to infer the disease rather than trying to predict the disease.
* Just like collaborative filtering where parameters and features are learned simultaneously.
