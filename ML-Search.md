Email: "Internet decay"
* http://www.vox.com/2015/8/6/9099357/internet-dead-end
* "What links these seemingly dissimilar stories is a very basic fear â€” the idea that the internet as we knew it, the internet of five or 10 or 20 years ago, is going away as surely as print media, replaced by a new internet that reimagines personal identity as something easily commodified, that plays less on the desire for information or thoughtfulness than it does the desire for a quick jolt of emotion."
* I.e. like reality TV.  So why can't machine learning (e.g. Watson) correct the internet back to it's previous state?  People experience the internet through search.  If the searching mechanism doesn't point to reality TV, then [reality TV] might as well not exist, as far as a user is concerned.

Email: Phonetics search and spellcheck (9/17/15)
* Why does typing into a search box only suggest word completions that have the same characters as I'm typing?
* Why not suggest word completions that match the phonetics of what I'm typing?
* This might be a poor example, but I was searching for the Neue Gallerie, but I couldn't remember how it was spelled: Noye Gallery?
* Also, suggested spelling don't seem to go beyond having a single character mispelled, nor do they seem to know about how close characters are to each other on the (phone) keyboard.
* Spellcheck should work the same way, using phonetics.
