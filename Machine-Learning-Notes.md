* This link on Recurrent Neural Networks was linked to from the above: http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/
  * "RNNs combine the input vector with their state vector with a fixed (but learned) function to produce a new state vector"
  * "If training vanilla neural nets is optimization over functions, training recurrent nets is optimization over programs."
  * "crucially this output vector's contents are influenced not only by the input you just fed in, but also on the entire history of inputs you've fed in in the past."  I.e. this links back to learning in stages (pixels, lines, shapes, faces; or regimes, sectors, instruments).

* "Once deep (or maybe not that deep) network is pretrained, input vectors are transformed to a better representation and resulting vectors are finally passed to real classifier (such as SVM or logistic regression). In an image above it means that at the very bottom there's one more component that actually does classification."

Interview with Cloudera CEO Mike Olson (2010)
* http://www.holehouse.org/mlclass/17_Large_Scale_Machine_Learning.html
* People still use relational databases - great if you have predictable queries over structured data
* But the data people want to work with is becoming more complex and bigger
  * Free text, unstructured data doesn't fit will into tables
  * Do sentiment analysis in SQL isn't really that good
  * So to do new kinds of processing need a new type of architecture
* Hadoop lets you do data processing - not transactional processing - on the big scale
* Increasingly things like NoSQL is being used

Email: "Deep learning to understand..."
* ...anything we don't. Anything we can observe effect and input, but not transmission mechanism.
* E.g. the inner workings of the brain. Which would be very meta, b/c it would be like a machine learning a machine that learns a machine.
* E.g. machine learning to learn the structure of a neural net.  A neural net learning a neural net.  What if it could learn what the outputs and inputs are rather than being programmed to know them.
