* "So, if we already had PCA, why the hell did we come up with autoencoders and RBMs? It turns out that PCA only allows linear transformation of a data vectors."

* "Once deep (or maybe not that deep) network is pretrained, input vectors are transformed to a better representation and resulting vectors are finally passed to real classifier (such as SVM or logistic regression). In an image above it means that at the very bottom there's one more component that actually does classification."

Email: "Deep learning to understand..."
* ...anything we don't. Anything we can observe effect and input, but not transmission mechanism.
* E.g. the inner workings of the brain. Which would be very meta, b/c it would be like a machine learning a machine that learns a machine.
* E.g. machine learning to learn the structure of a neural net.  A neural net learning a neural net.  What if it could learn what the outputs and inputs are rather than being programmed to know them.
