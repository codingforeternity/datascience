#### .bashrc vs. .bash_profile
* .bashrc is only sourced for non-login shells, like terminals that you start once you've already logged in
* .bash_profile is sourced when you login
* "Most of the time you donâ€™t want to maintain two separate config files for login and non-login shells--when you set a PATH, you want it to apply to both. You can fix this by sourcing .bashrc from your .bash_profile file, then putting PATH and common settings in .bashrc.  To do this, add the following lines to .bash_profile:
  * ```if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then
    source ~/.bashrc
fi```
