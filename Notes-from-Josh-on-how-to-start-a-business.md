What follows are some notes based on a conversation I had with Josh on 1/12/17.

  1. Legal is incredibly important
    * interview different lawyers -- free legal advice
    * show lawyer old employment agreements
    * "MAKE SURE YOU FILE A 403B ELECTION!!!!!!!  This ensures you don't owe taxes on the vesting shares in your company."
      * get return receipt for 403B
      * the lawyer will file it, even though they say they won't
      * need to staple it to a paper copy of next year's personal tax return
    * "negotiate [$25k] deferred payment so you only pay them once you raise or make money"
    * will have to make a marketing pitch to lawyer
    * 125-question list after seeing initial contract from lawyer
    * I would stay a consultant to avoid salary, o/w my work not owned by the company
    * two ways to buy shares in the company
      1. by selling my IP to the company (bad - former employers could assert ownership in the future)
      2. by buying the shares w/ cash (good - former employers can't assert ownership of my $)
    * (even though it's not true) don't tell lawyer just want to be a small business (b/c then not worth his while)... tell him I'm going for a Series A (VC financing)
    * todo: lookup what a "cap table" is
  2. Employees/Advisors
    * have every person sign an agreement, no matter how small (recall: Facebook)
    * don't give out more than a 1/4 point of equity to anyone (it would still need to vest, and you can let people go before vesting)
    * require semi-annual meetings (if for no other reason than to have a way to fire someone)
    * lots of companies die b/c of stupid "gotchas" particularly wrt off-the-book employees (e.g. Facebook, PhotoLog) who could claim ownership at some future point.  VC won't touch such a company
  3. Patents
    * Josh has a good attorney for this who will write the patent and do the diagrams
    * about 7 year to fully process
    * $10k up-front cost for writing/filing
      * used to be $1k up-front and then 10 later on, but companies were taking advantage of the system and filing definition-less, TBD disclosures so that they could use them to assert retroactive ownership of ideas
  4. Marketing
    * hand out hats with company logo to everyone
    * market up the wazoo -- biz cards, shirts, etc. -- really important
  5. Other jobs / future directions
    * count on this being a 5 year thing
    * if go and get a job then having a company allows for a place to carve out IP
    * can put vesting on hold in such a circumstance
