#### [Google's Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software works for 248+ languages]

* Google's OCR is probably using dependencies of [Tesseract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesseract_(software)), an OCR engine released as free software, or [OCRopus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCRopus), a free document analysis and optical character recognition (OCR) system that is primarily used in Google Books.
* [Document layout analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_layout_analysis)
  * "It is a common assumption in both document layout analysis algorithms and optical character recognition algorithms that the characters in the document image are oriented so that text lines are horizontal. Therefore, if there is skew present then it is important to rotate the document image so as to remove it.  *It follows that the first steps in any document layout analysis code are to remove image noise and to come up with an estimate for the skew angle of the document.*"
