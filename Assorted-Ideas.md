2 Problems with Maps Apps
1. They aren't predictive.  E.g. what will the traffic be like on a summer Friday afternoon leaving the city.  I.e. they aren't forward looking.  But they're not backwards looking either.  If there's unexpected traffic (e.g. due to an accident) and all of a sudden traffic begins to flow freely again, that should be accounted for very quickly.
2. The graph being traversed shouldn't have intersections as its nodes; rather nodes should be points before and after intersections because it might take longer to turn left than go straight.  Take for example, exiting off of Rte 91 North onto Rte 84 East.

Email: The only way to learn is to mess up (10/1/15)
* Even theory-based learning requires the testing of theories
* i.e. using controls where on one side of the "line of control" lies the theory and the other side is "messed up" (i.e. the anti-theory)

DATA!
* IDEA: http://www.data.gov/

Email: Create a company...
* ...that rather than trying to always make things better, like google, tries to prevent things from becoming worse, by stifling innovation for example.  Every cost against rent seeking

Email: ML for aggregated knowledge
* On the Web for example. How many sites support a particular point of view
* Internetal Consensus!

Idea: Feature Engineering for input and output features
* Not only do we want systems to learn the input features automatically, we should also want them to learn the output features automatically.
* We want them to learn what types of questions might be asked.  They should act as a sort of database query language.
* E.g. given data.gov, we should be able to ask questions about any entity (the economy, specific companies or countries) that might have a relationship to that sort of data

Email: data support via ML for spoken/written words (9/17/15)
* People say all sorts of shit, but its very rarely backed up by data.  It would be really cool if given some statement, one could use ML to look for support for that statement in all the data.

Email: back data out of published results (9/17/15)
* just like in the ML course where features are backed out of ratings (low rank matrix factorization)
* if data could be backed out of published results, then the data could be combined with data from other studies and "meta-data studies" could be born

Email: ML for myths
* Eg diets
* Things with tons of unproven "knowledge"
* Can myths/diets be debunked using ML?

Email: ML for understanding babies
* How many theories are there?  How many don't have any supporting evidence--like psychology?
* Understand what their cries and motions mean

Email: Babies whack themselves in their faces (10/1/15)
* Because they're learning, just like back propagation.

Email: Newest cyber threat will be data manipulation, US intelligence chief says | Technology | The Guardian
* ML cyber security. All data must be publicly confirmable--like with Bitcoin.

Email: Did the Chinese stock market crash BECAUSE US unemployment has dropped so low? Ie risk of rising rates? (9/17/15)
* I.e. contrary to what the following post suggests
* [Why the Federal Reserve Decided to Wait a Few Months Before Messing With the Economy](http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2015/09/17/federal_reserve_september_decision_janet_yellen_decides_not_to_mess_with.html)
