[Deep or Shallow, NLP is Breaking Out](http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/3/198856-deep-or-shallow-nlp-is-breaking-out/fulltext) (11/1/16)
* "Yoav Goldberg and Omer Levy, researchers at Bar-Ilan University in Ramat-Gan, Israel, have concluded much of [word2vec's] power comes from tuning algorithmic elements such as dynamically sized context windows. Goldberg and Levy call those elements hyperparameters."

[Google Has Open Sourced SyntaxNet, Its AI for Understanding Language](http://www.wired.com/2016/05/google-open-sourced-syntaxnet-ai-natural-language/) (5/13/16)
* "According to Google, Parsey McParseface is about 94 percent accurate in identifying how a word relates the rest of a sentence, a rate the company believes is close to the performance of a human (96 to 97 percent)."
* "people use language on the web in so many different ways. When Google trains its neural nets with this kind of dataset, the accuracy rate drops to about 90 percent"

NLP "features" shouldn't be functions of text passages, but rather correlations to sets of terms (just like QELA).  The relationships/correlations between the pairwise text-QELA terms are the features.
