#### [Moving hosting from GoDaddy to AWS](http://serverfault.com/questions/611805/switching-hosting-from-godaddy-to-aws)
* "In order to move from GoDaddy to AWS, you can a) **just move your code to AWS** (if you have a static website, move it to S3 instead of EC2), **and point your GoDaddy DNS records at your new host** (e.g. your EC2 instance's IP address). In EC2, your instance's IP address will change when the instance reboots, etc. As such it is a dynamic IP address, not well suited for hosting a website. Instead, **you need to allocate a static IP address, once that can be assigned to an instance - AWS call this an 'Elastic IP'. This is what you will use for your A record. (The same holds true whether you use GoDaddy's DNS or Route53** - you need an A record that points to the IP address of your server - but **there is no requirement to use Route53 just because you are using AWS to host** your site - there are some exceptions - e.g. using an elastic load balancer)."
