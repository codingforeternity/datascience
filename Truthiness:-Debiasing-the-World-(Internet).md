#### Contrastive divergence to suppress biases (3/19/17)
* Take 2 people, expose one to bias inducing stimula and another not, and take the difference as truth.

#### On debiasing (3/19/17)
* Morey (The Undoing Project) wouldn't watch scrimmage games and didn't allow comparisons based on race.
* Ads and Twitter messages are geared to incite bias.  Can it be undone?
* Commonsensemedia on zootopia was biased by adult-think.  It should have focused more on scary animal scenes (more likely to give kids nightmares) than adult innuendo that kids wouldn't even get.
* A.k.a.: delouse the web

#### how do you assess intelligence while filtering out smooth talkers (3/8/17)
* too much of politics (job searches, etc) seems to select for the "smooth talker"

#### What I find strange is people who think this has only recently become relevant (2/28/17)

* Use the Obviousness Test to Spot Garbage Science News http://lifehacker.com/use-the-obviousness-test-to-spot-garbage-science-news-1791280568

#### News bias (1/13/17)
* Just heard a reporter report "carries a maximum sentence of life in prison" which is true, but why did they only report the max?  Because they are optimizing for viewers, not truth.
* Kws: truthiness

#### Truthiness (1/3/17)
* Even one person can embody different levels of truthiness. In a way Friedman and Krugman (and esp. that CS dude at MIT) both shift back and forth between truthier academic pursuits and advertisingier political (truth lacking) pursuits.
  * 2007 Krugman on Milton Friedman http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2016/12/2007-krugman-on-milton-friedman.html
* CS dude at MIT = Noam Chomsky
* Let us denote proposition P applied in world w∈W by P(w). The meaning of P is then the mapping v_P:W→{0,1} which assigns 1 or 0 to each w∈W according to whether or not proposition P(w) is true. Equivalently, the meaning of the proposition is the ordered pair consisting of: all worlds, and the subset of worlds where it is true: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.08627.pdf]

#### Confirmation bias is the root of all evil (1/2/17)
* The more news there is, the easier it is for people to participate in confirmation bias. The more CB the bigger the problem. So how does one neutralize wrt CB?
* Or how does one tailor his life to avoid CB?
* What is this type of self experimentation, self optimization, called?
