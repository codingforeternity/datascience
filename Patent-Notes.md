A patent is a description of *an idea* that is **novel or unique**, **useful**, and **non-obvious**.
* novel or unique - the invention must claim some new element/feature/function or **combination**
* useful - must include sufficient details such that a skilled person can make and use it.  i.e. how does it work?  can't patent a time machine
* non-obvious - must have a specific **inventive step** not obvious to others (a big enough step)

Disclose
* novel features
* novel features that were considered but left on the drawing board
* future potential features (for me or others)
* any other related novel ideas

3 Parts
* background & problem (and make sure the problem comes before the solution, not the other way around)
  * invention domain - 1-2 paragraphs max, start broad, describe problem, not solution
  * concrete example (brief)
  * prior art table - clean and effective format (columns: keywords, prior art, citation, description & disadvantages)
  * known solutions and drawbacks to them (and why is an additional solution required)
* summary (including differentiating prior art, examples, figures)
  * high level description (1-3 sentences)
  * 1-3 more sentences describing advantages of proposed solution
* implementation details
  * preferred realization/embodiment - 3-5 sentences, concrete terms to be broadcasted throughout the patent, high level
  * impl details - most important section, vivid detail, numbered outline effective (8-12 items), can translate directly to attorney claims
  * example - 1-2 paragraphs or a list, concrete, perhaps reference earlier example
  * optional: alternative realizations, graph/diagram/visual aid, more examples

Beware the "magic box."  Don't just say what something does (e.g. transform input to output) say how it does it.
