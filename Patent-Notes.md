A patent is a description of *an idea* that is **novel or unique**, **useful**, and **non-obvious**.
* novel or unique - the invention must claim some new element/feature/function or **combination**
* useful - must include sufficient details such that a skilled person can make and use it.  i.e. how does it work?  can't patent a time machine
* non-obvious - must have a specific **inventive step** not obvious to others (a big enough step)

Disclose
# novel features
# novel features that were considered but left on the drawing board
# future potential features (for me or others)
# any other related novel ideas

3 Parts
1. background & problem (and make sure the problem comes before the solution, not the other way around)
2. summary (including differentiating prior art, examples, figures)
3. implementation details

Beware the "magic box."  Don't just say what something does (e.g. transform input to output) say how it does it.
