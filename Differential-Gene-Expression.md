Email: "The 'what did I eat toilet'"
* Reconstruct what someone ate from their poo. This could help to reduce the number of variables in genetics studies (GWAS), one of the main problems of which is that they have too many variables.
* Also are someone's changes in gene expression levels during such a study ever indicative of anything? Is anything like that ever measured? If you can tell if someone's a smoker by their expression levels then surely, at some horizon, changes in those levels have meaning. Use machine learning to figure it out. But first you need inputs, e.g. poo.
