The basic idea is to have a journal that only publishes negative results.  Results are selected for publication based on the quality of the application of the scientific method.

Email: Graveyard database of negative results
* Put them somewhere so they can be studied w/ big data methods
* I.e. somewhere for the data associated with the negative results to go, even if the paper doesn't get published (in JoNR or o/w), even if the research isn't ever finished perhaps we can prevent the data from being abandoned
