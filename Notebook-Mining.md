* This wiki is effectively my notebook.
* If lots of other people had similar notebooks, perhaps they could be mined for various purposes.  E.g. profitable ideas or new innovations.
* One could even incentivize people to do this--via offering rewards (recall that prizes often produce better than grants) for ideas that are used, for example.
* What to call it? Notebook Mining, Idea Distillation, The Internet of Ideas?
