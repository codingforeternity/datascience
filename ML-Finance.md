* Just like image recognition starts with pixels, then lines, then shapes, then objects.
* Stock forecasting should happen in the same granular/machine to general/human sort of way.
* How those forecasts are best used though is another problem going in the opposite direction. Like an hourglass. From the human/trader to the market/machine.
* Perhaps there can be different dimensions of generalization happening at the same time. Factor models are somewhat orthogonal to the dimension described in the previous paragraphs, for example. Orthogonal neural nets (which might just be closer to how a brain actually works where different sensory systems interact with each other).
