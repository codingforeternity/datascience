#### [All About the New Google RankBrain Algorithm](http://searchengineland.com/faq-all-about-the-new-google-rankbrain-algorithm-234440) (3/2/17)
* [The Periodic Table Of SEO Success Factors](http://searchengineland.com/seotable)
* [Google: Hummingbird](http://searchengineland.com/library/google/hummingbird-google)
* What exactly does RankBrain do?
  * From emailing with Google, I gather RankBrain is mainly used as a way to interpret the searches that people submit to find pages that might not have the exact words that were searched for.
* The Bloomberg article did have a single example of a search where RankBrain is supposedly helping. Here it is:
  * "What's the title of the consumer at the highest level of a food chain?"
  * Imagine that RankBrain is connecting that original long and complicated query to this much shorter one: "highest level of a food chain"
* In October 2015, Google told Bloomberg that a "very large fraction" of the 15 percent of queries it normally never sees before were processed by RankBrain. In short, 15 percent or less. In June 2016, news emerged that RankBrain was being used for every query that Google handles. See our story about that
  * FWC - so RankBrain is mainly useful for translating from a set of search terms that's never been seen before to a set of terms that has been seen (i.e. **semantic search**)
  * FWC - The article goes on to say that RankBrain is word embeddings and to see this blog post: [Learning the meaning behind words](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2013/08/learning-meaning-behind-words.html)

#### [PageRank on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank) (3/2/17)
* "The PageRank algorithm outputs a probability distribution used to represent the likelihood that a person randomly clicking on links will arrive at any particular page... It is assumed in several research papers that the distribution is evenly divided among all documents in the collection at the beginning of the computational process."  The algorithm iterates to update the distribution a bit in each pass.
  * Problem: This still has the problem that it is based on "random clicking" as opposed to "clicking according to some prior distribution."  Could a MCMC approach be used here to improve the "random"/uniform prior?
    * Solution: "The original PageRank algorithm reflects the so-called random surfer model, meaning that the PageRank of a particular page is derived from the theoretical probability of visiting that page when clicking on links at random. A page ranking model that reflects the importance of a particular page as a function of how many actual visits it receives by real users is called the *intentional surfer model*."
  * "The formula uses a model of a random surfer who gets bored after several clicks and switches to a random page. The PageRank value of a page reflects the chance that the random surfer will land on that page by clicking on a link. It can be understood as a Markov chain in which the states are pages"
  * "When calculating PageRank, pages with no outbound links are assumed to link out to all other pages in the collection. Their PageRank scores are therefore divided evenly among all other pages. In other words, to be fair with pages that are not sinks, these random transitions are added to all nodes in the Web, with a residual probability usually set to **d = 0.85, estimated from the frequency that an average surfer uses his or her browser's bookmark feature**."
* "Because of the large eigengap of the modified adjacency matrix above, the values of the PageRank eigenvector can be approximated to within a high degree of accuracy *within only a few [52] iterations*."
* "The [search engine results page (SERP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_results_page) rank of a web page is a function not only of its PageRank, but of a relatively large and continuously adjusted set of factors (over 200)"
* "Google elaborated on the reasons for PageRank deprecation at Q&A #March and announced **Links** (#1) and **Content** (#2) as the Top Ranking Factors, **RankBrain** (#3) was announced as the #3 Ranking Factor in October 2015 so the Top 3 Factors are now confirmed officially by Google."

* See Agapiev's answer in particular.
  * "For crawling, it does not make sense to bother doing your own as nowadays there are many good open source choices such as Nutch, Scrapy, Heritrix etc."
* [CommonCrawl](http://commoncrawl.org/big-picture/frequently-asked-questions/) - the web, crawled for us

#### Another problem with Google search (10/17/15)
* It leads to a lot of anecdotal evidence.
* Which just happens to be a massive percentage of the evidence for and against baby products of all kinds.
* Take for example: http://www.candokiddo.com/news/rocknplay
* This is a well read site.  But it's nothing but anecdotal.
* It would be great to see a reliability score for it.

#### Email: Watson for reviews (10/6/15)
* Filter reviews and return a re-aggregated list of relevant ones, according to an individual's preferences and their validity.
* Use collaborative filtering (CF) for ailments/problems rather than human-understandable problems.  I.e., use our 8 ailments and CF back to EMRA problems.
* Use Watson for any user-specific record, like EMRs.

#### Email: "Internet decay"
* http://www.vox.com/2015/8/6/9099357/internet-dead-end
* "What links these seemingly dissimilar stories is a very basic fear â€” the idea that the internet as we knew it, the internet of five or 10 or 20 years ago, is going away as surely as print media, replaced by a new internet that reimagines personal identity as something easily commodified, that plays less on the desire for information or thoughtfulness than it does the desire for a quick jolt of emotion."
* I.e. like reality TV.  So why can't machine learning (e.g. Watson) correct the internet back to it's previous state?  People experience the internet through search.  If the searching mechanism doesn't point to reality TV, then [reality TV] might as well not exist, as far as a user is concerned.

#### Email: Phonetics search and spellcheck (9/17/15)
* Why does typing into a search box only suggest word completions that have the same characters as I'm typing?
* Why not suggest word completions that match the phonetics of what I'm typing?
* This might be a poor example, but I was searching for the Neue Gallerie, but I couldn't remember how it was spelled: Noye Gallery?
* Also, suggested spelling don't seem to go beyond having a single character mispelled, nor do they seem to know about how close characters are to each other on the (phone) keyboard.
* Spellcheck should work the same way, using phonetics.

#### Idea: Watson seems to have required rules to play _Jeopardy!_
* I.e. rules had to be programmed such as the relationship of the category headings to the questions.
* Why couldn't the relationship have been learned?
* I suppose spatial relatedness (rows/columns) would have to be learned first.
* But wouldn't this be the similar to learning faces with a hierarchical network?
  * pixels -> lines -> motifs-> sub-objects -> objects
  * spatial relations -> rows/columns -> categories -> question hints

#### Email: Is there a watson search engine (6/12/15)
* And if not why? It should be configurable along any dimension, eg trustworthiness, that it's user specifies
* http://searchengineland.com/goodbye-blekko-search-engine-joins-ibms-watson-team-217633
* http://searchengineland.com/google-forecloses-on-content-farms-with-farmer-algorithm-update-66071
* Google has a "search quality team"
* Reliability of results isn't exactly what this would want to target, but rather it should target "scientific basis."  Which content has basis in science vs. not?  Can this be assessed using NLP?  AI?  Comparison to scientific research? Can NLP be used to distinguish between what is science and what is hearsay?
* Also see: FactCheck.org and SciCheck.org, the first (and maybe the second) of which has a page that lists "trusted sources" such as the CBO.
* Such a search engine could be constructed to _cross-check_ (potential name?) against any set of sources.  Scientific sources could be one thing to cross-check against.  PDFs could be another.  Religious sources could be another. (set-differences between sources might be interesting: <science> - <religion> = <?>)
