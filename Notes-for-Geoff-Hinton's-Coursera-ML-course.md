Lec 2: Types of Neural Network Architectures
* Ilya Sutskever (2011) trained special type or RNN to predict next char in sequence
  * it generates text by predicting the probability distribution for the next char, not the highest likely next char (which would generate text like "the united states of the united states of the..."), and then sampling from that distribution
* symmetric nets are much easier to analyze than RNNs (John Hopfield)
  * but they're more restricted, e.g. can't learn cycles
