[Agile no longer addresses the fundamental bottleneck](http://www.loosecouplings.com/2016/05/agile-and-bottlenecks.html) (5/24/16)
* "The first step in building the right thing is to avoid building wrong things along the way."
* "In essence what is needed is the adoption of a Lean Startup mindset and the creation of a toolbox of techniques for (in)validation." -- i.e. optimal stopping point

[What are User Stories? ](http://specify.io/concepts/user-stories) (3/7/16)
* "User stories are not requirements, they are a concept to communicate requirements."
* FWC - If Agile is so effective, then why are there so many articles that try to explain it?  Does anyone really get it?  And even if there is a subset of people who do get it, how can it be effective given that there are so many people who don't.

[Agile Is The New Waterfall](https://medium.com/@ayasin/agile-is-the-new-waterfall-f7baef5d026d) (10/13/15)
* All successful processes are unique. You can’t read a book and go through it’s 12 steps to build great software any more than you can read a book, go through it’s 12 steps and come up with the next big thing.
* Only add processes that reduce significant actual risk. Create process to help reduce a particular risk IF you can answer yes to one of these three questions:
  1.     Did an actual problem occur that was systemic and not just a one off? _Example: Sally and Bob both repeatedly started working on the same feature, and don’t figure it out for 2 days because there’s no way for them to do so._
  2. Is risk of a problem occurring very high? _Example: drives crash often enough that if your source isn’t checked into source control for a month, there’s a real risk of significant loss._
  3. Would a problem have catastrophic consequences? _Example: if a wing falls off a plane in flight, it’s game over for everyone on board._
