* All successful processes are unique. You can’t read a book and go through it’s 12 steps to build great software any more than you can read a book, go through it’s 12 steps and come up with the next big thing.
* Only add processes that reduce significant actual risk. Create process to help reduce a particular risk IF you can answer yes to one of these three questions:
  1.     Did an actual problem occur that was systemic and not just a one off? _Example: Sally and Bob both repeatedly started working on the same feature, and don’t figure it out for 2 days because there’s no way for them to do so._
  2. Is risk of a problem occurring very high? _Example: drives crash often enough that if your source isn’t checked into source control for a month, there’s a real risk of significant loss._
  3. Would a problem have catastrophic consequences? _Example: if a wing falls off a plane in flight, it’s game over for everyone on board._
